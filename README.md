Insights from the donation data to inform fund raising strategy and increase donations.

As a data analyst working for the charity, Education for All. I have been asked by the head of fundraising to present the data on donor insights and donation rates as a fundraising team member. In two weeks, time, there will be a fundraising strategy meeting for the following year, and I need to present insights from the donation data to inform our fundraising strategy and increase donations.
My objectives are to:
Increase the number of donors in our database.
Increase the donation frequency of our donors.
Increase the value of donations in our database.

Two sets of data were provided for this project and they both contain information about the donors and their donations.
‘Efo_donation_data’ has donors’ first name, last name, email, gender, job field, donation amount, state, and shirt size in it.
‘Efo_donor_data’ has donors’ id, frequency of donation, university,  car, second language, and favorite movie genre.
